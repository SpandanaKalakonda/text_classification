ABSTRACT 
Social media platforms such as Twitter have become an essential 
source of user-generated content for researchers, offering valuable 
insights into user behavior and preferences. One aspect of this is 
categorizing posts based on location, which can inform us about 
the origin of a tweet. The ability to accurately classify tweets 
based on public place has numerous potential applications, such as 
identifying popular venues or events, tracking the spread of 
diseases or viral content, and analyzing sentiment and opinions of 
users in specific locations. In this study, we try to classify the 
tweets based on textual content of tweet to a public place such as 
a hospital, restaurant, airport, church, or zoo using machine 
learning models - Logistic Regression (LR), Long-Short-Term 
Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
and a Parallel CNN â€“ and compare their performance. The aim of 
our study is to investigate the potential of these models for 
accurately classifying tweets based on their content. Our findings 
reveal that the LR model with n-grams achieved an accuracy of 
82.8%, the CNN and LSTM models with one hidden layer 
performed similarly to this baseline, achieving accuracies of 83% 
and 82%, respectively. On the other hand, we observed that the 
parallel CNN model, with its advanced architecture and multiple 
convolutional layers, was the most effective in classifying tweets 
accurately, achieving an impressive accuracy of 93%. This 
indicates that the parallel CNN model is better suited for handling 
the complexities of social media text data and can provide more 
accurate location-based analysis of tweets. The potential areas for 
future research can be identifying the crowd of people who are 
tweeting from a particular public place, which can help in 
analyzing how public places become popular over time, which can 
be used to enhance marketing strategies and improve customer 
experiences in those areas.
